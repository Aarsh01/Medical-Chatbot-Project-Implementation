# LLMOPS:
-> LLMOps stands for large language model operations, and it's the process of managing and operating large language models (LLMs). 
-> LLMs are AI models that are trained on large datasets of code and text, allowing them to perform language-related tasks like: 
	1. text generation, 	
	2. question answering,
	3. translation.
